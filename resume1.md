### **How to Use This Template:**

1. **Fill in the [Placeholders]** in the header, summary, and education sections.
2. **Adjust the Job Title/Company:** I've grouped all projects under one "Professional Experience" block. You can set the company to **Verizon** or a **consulting firm** you worked for (e.g., "Senior Consultant at XYZ, assigned to Verizon").
3. **Review & Prune:** This includes *everything*. For a specific job application, **delete** bullet points or even whole projects that aren't relevant to that job's description. A 1-2 page resume is ideal.
